This repository contains the architecture of Advanced-VGG models from the paper "Enhancing the accuracies by performing pooling decisions adjacent to the output layer"
(https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-40566-y) 

Advanced-VGG with m layers (A-VGGm), using pooling decisions adjacent to the last convolutional layer significantly enhance accuracies on CIFAR-10.
The results indicate A-VGG8’s accuracy is superior to VGG16’s, and that the accuracies of A-VGG13 and A-VGG16 are equal, and comparable to that of Wide-ResNet16 on CIFAR-10.
